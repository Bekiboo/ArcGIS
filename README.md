# Overview

I developped this project to test the integration of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript with Svelte. The project is a simple map application that displays a map of Antananarivo and allows the user to search for Point Of Interests and filter them by types. The project uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to display the map and search for locations. The project uses Svelte to create the user interface and handle user input.
